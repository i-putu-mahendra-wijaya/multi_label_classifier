class DaoCloudStorage:
    """
        Data Access Object (DAO) for interacting with Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

        This class provides a high-level, idempotent interface for common GCS
        operations, including creating a client, managing buckets, and performing
        file (blob) operations such as upload, download, and deletion.

        The class relies on a :class:`.CredentialAccessor` instance to obtain
        GCP service account credentials, the default project ID, and the target
        location for GCS operations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        credential_accessor : CredentialAccessor
            An object that provides access to the GCP service account credentials
            and project ID used for GCS interactions.

        Attributes
        ----------
        credential_accessor : CredentialAccessor
            Reference to the credential accessor provided during initialization.
        mygcs : google.cloud.storage.client.Client
            GCS client used to perform all interactions with Google Cloud Storage.

        This method walks through the specified local directory and uploads
        **all files** found (recursively) to the target GCS bucket while
        preserving the relative directory structure. Subdirectories are
        implicitly created in GCS through object naming.

        Each local file's relative path (with respect to ``local_folder_path``)
        is appended to the provided ``gcs_folder_prefix`` to construct the
        destination object path in GCS.

        Bucket existence is validated implicitly through
        :meth:`upload_blob_from_file`, which will attempt to create the bucket
        if it does not already exist.

        Parameters
        ----------
        gcs_bucket_name : str
            Name of the destination GCS bucket.
        local_folder_path : str or :class:`pathlib.Path`, optional
            Path to the local folder whose contents should be uploaded.
            Defaults to the current working directory (``"."``).
        gcs_folder_prefix : str, optional
            Prefix (folder path) within the GCS bucket under which all files
            will be uploaded. This is prepended to each file's relative path.
            Defaults to an empty string, uploading files to the bucket root.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return a value. Upload failures for individual
            files are handled internally and logged via standard output.

        Notes
        -----
        - Only files are uploaded; directories themselves are skipped.
        - File uploads are performed one-by-one using
          :meth:`upload_blob_from_file`.
        - Existing objects with the same path in GCS will be overwritten.
        - The operation is **not atomic**: partial uploads may occur if an
          error happens mid-process.

        --------
        Upload an entire local directory to a GCS folder:

        Delete a specific GCS object (blob).

        This method is **idempotent**: if the object or its container bucket
        does not exist, the function returns success without error, as the
        desired state (object removed) is already achieved.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bucket_name : str
            Name of the GCS bucket containing the object.
        object_name : str
            The full key or path of the object in GCS to be deleted.

        Returns
        -------
        bool or None
            ``True`` if the object was successfully deleted or was already
            absent (idempotency), or ``None`` if a cloud error prevents the
            operation.
